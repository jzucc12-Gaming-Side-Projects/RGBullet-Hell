This is a solo-developed project where I worked on all aspects of the programming. The concept was based on my and fellow Astral Arkade co-founder, Tyler Schacht's, idea to make a bullet hell where you were selectively invulnerable to certain enemies. With Tyler's permission, I took this base idea and expanded on it to create RGBullet Hell. I focused on creating an exciting and tactical gameplay loop for players by consistently iterating on features from playtesting and feedback.

In RGBullet Hell, what doesn't kill you gives you ammo!

Each weapons and enemy is linked to a specific color. When using a weapon, you can only hurt enemies that match your weapon's color. Enemy bullets that match your weapon's color give that weapon ammo instead of hurting you. If you take too many hits while using a certain weapon then it is game over!

<p>⮞ Created a fast-paced and tactical experience that is easy to pick up and play.</p>
<p>⮞ Utilized scriptable objects and the strategy pattern to easily create a wide array of enemy and weapon behaviors.</p>
<p>⮞ Prioritized accessibility by including features such as partial control re-mapping, slow motion feature, and colorblindness settings.</p>
