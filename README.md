<h2>Summary</h2>
This is a solo-developed project where I worked on all aspects of the programming. The concept was based on my and fellow Astral Arkade co-founder, Tyler Schacht's, idea to make a bullet hell where you were selectively invulnerable to certain enemies. With Tyler's permission, I took this base idea and expanded on it to create RGBullet Hell. I focused on creating an exciting and tactical gameplay loop for players by consistently iterating on features from playtesting and feedback.

In RGBullet Hell, what doesn't kill you gives you ammo!

Each weapons and enemy is linked to a specific color. When using a weapon, you can only hurt enemies that match your weapon's color. Enemy bullets that match your weapon's color give that weapon ammo instead of hurting you. If you take too many hits while using a certain weapon then it is game over!

<p>⮞ Created a fast-paced and tactical experience that is easy to pick up and play.</p>
<p>⮞ Utilized scriptable objects and the strategy pattern to easily create a wide array of enemy and weapon behaviors.</p>
<p>⮞ Prioritized accessibility by including features such as partial control re-mapping, slow motion feature, and colorblindness settings.</p>


<h2>New Repository Update</h2>
<p>This project came from a previous repository that contained 3rd party assets. Most art, music, and sfx files have now been witheld from the repository for redistribution purposes. The following packages are also needed in order to run the project properly. If opened without the multi-scene package, note that the "Player" scene contains the camera. You will need to load this scene in the hierarchy along with any level scenes if you wish to properly see the levels in the game view. Also note that the "Initialization" scene must be loaded before the "Player" scene and that the "Player" scene must be built before the "UI" scene.</p>
